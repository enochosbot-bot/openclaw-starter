# Production Queue

## Personal Setup
1. **Claude Code on phone** — Install Tailscale + Termius on phone, SSH to Mac mini (`100.124.44.74`, user: `deaconsopenclaw`), run `claude`. Ask Enoch to set up SSH key auth so no password needed. _Effort: 10 min_ _Priority: whenever_

## Active

### Console / Dashboard
1. **Search function for workspace files** — add a search UI to the console that can search across workspace files, memory, research, etc. Could use QMD (already indexed) as the backend. _Effort: medium_ _Priority: normal_
2. **API spending dashboard** — track and display costs across all APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Twilio, X API, ngrok, etc.). Usage breakdowns by service, time period, per-session. Charts + totals. Pull from provider dashboards/APIs where possible. _Effort: high_ _Priority: normal_
   - **X API deep-dive section** — dedicated view for X/Twitter API usage. Log each request with what it was doing (search query, topic, who triggered it), endpoint hit, credits consumed, timestamps. Searchable history so you can see exactly what's been looked up and when. _Effort: medium_
   - **Brave Search API usage** — track Brave API calls (web_search tool), queries made, timestamps, which session triggered them. Include in spending dashboard alongside other services. _Effort: low-medium_
3. **Knowledge graph visualization** — visual graph of entities, relationships, and connections across memory/research/notes. Nodes = people, projects, concepts, tools. Edges = relationships. Interactive, explorable from the console. _Effort: high_ _Priority: normal_

### OpenNotes iOS App
- MinimaList clone — dead-simple task list
- Swift/SwiftUI, iOS 17+, MVVM
- Full spec: `projects/task-app/SPEC.md`
- Core: swipe gestures (cross-off, delete, add), haptics, focus timer, dark mode
- Personal use first, App Store if it rocks
- _Effort: high_ _Priority: high_

### 📚 Bookshelf Dashboard
- Visual bookshelf display for the castle/console dashboard
- Book covers, read/unread/partial status, reading progress
- Sourced from the Bookshelf topic catalog (Ezra-maintained)
- Cross-references to Anna's Archive / Open Library for free copies
- Author bios, summaries, the user's personal notes on each book
- _Effort: medium_ _Priority: normal_

### Content Creator Cataloging
- Start with **Reformation Church** — scrape all articles, statements of faith, theological positions
- Build structured reference: beliefs, reasoning, scriptural basis
- Foundation for the user's personal theological knowledge base
- Future: expand to other creators, generate shorts from long-form content
- _Effort: high_ _Priority: normal_

### Google Photos Organization
- Go through the user's photos and name/organize them
- Need to confirm: are they in Drive or Google Photos proper?
- If Drive → use `gog` CLI. If Photos → need Photos API OAuth setup.
- Low urgency — do during slow periods
- _Effort: high (volume)_ _Priority: low_

### X Bookmarks OAuth
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Secret saved
- Auth flow script ready at `scripts/x-bookmarks-auth.sh`
- Need to re-run auth flow when browser cooperates
- Once done: nightly bookmark scan cron job



### Increased Hardening & Security
- **Full review doc:** `research/security-hardening-review_2026-02-16.md` (also on Google Drive)
- **Status:** 🟡 Future work — not implementing now. Will revisit at a later date.
- **Summary of items (8 total):**
  1. API keys → Apple Keychain (out of ~/.zshrc)
  2. Lock personality files (chmod 444, root-owned)
  3. Change default gateway port
  4. Fix data processing transparency claims
  5. Granular Google OAuth scopes (read-only vs send)
  6. Update Tirith docs (doesn't cover OpenClaw exec)
  7. Docker sandboxing for agents
  8. Clean-room sub-agent pattern for cloud requests
- **Source:** the user's IT security specialist (Mark Blake) review

### 🔒 Data Flow Audit (PRIORITY — Tomorrow)
- Map every point where data leaves the machine
- Anthropic/OpenAI: what context gets sent per request, can we strip PII
- Google: OAuth scope audit, what data flows where
- Twilio: voice audio, transcriptions
- Brave: search queries
- Local LLM viability: what can Ollama handle to keep sensitive stuff on-machine
- Clean-room sub-agent implementation plan
- **Goal:** For Spectrum pitch — "here's exactly how client PII never touches a cloud API"
- _Effort: high_ _Priority: critical_

## Parked (Risk Review)
- **iMessage channel** — Full Disk Access granted, `imsg` CLI installed, Messages.app needs sign-in
- **Apple Notes integration** — AppleScript working, "Enoch" folder created, needs risk assessment before full wiring

## Completed
